Known errors:

1) Getting 1 question wrong on Easy section will branch immediately to a loss and back to the main menu.

2) Continuing to medium section from Easy section causes misprints in compile?

3) Medium win computes correct score but displays Easy win message.

Fixed errors:

1) Counter math updated to fit proper passing scores.

2) Some variables deleted due to no use.
